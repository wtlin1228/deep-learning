### Quiz 1 - Passing Values Forward

Create and run this graph!

Setup
Review `nn.py` and `miniflow.py`.

The neural network architecture is already there for you in `nn.py`. It's your job to finish `MiniFlow` to make it work.

For this quiz, I want you to:

1. Open `nn.py` below. You don't need to change anything. I just want you to see how `MiniFlow` works.

2. Open `miniflow.py`. Finish the `forward` method on the `Add` class. All that's required to pass this quiz is a correct implementation of `forward`.

3. Test your network by hitting "Test Run!" When the output looks right, hit "Submit!"
