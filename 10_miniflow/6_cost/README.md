### Instructions

For this quiz, you will run the forward pass against the network in nn.py. I want you to finish implementing the MSE method so that it calculates the cost from the equation above.

I recommend using the `np.square` (documentation) method to make your life easier.

Check out nn.py to see how `MSE` will calculate the cost.

1. Open miniflow.py. Finish building `MSE`.

2. Test your network! See if the cost makes sense given the inputs by playing with nn.py.
