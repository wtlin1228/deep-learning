## Setup

For this quiz you'll complete TODOs in both the f.py and gd.py files.

### Tasks:

+ Set the learning_rate in f.py.

+ Complete the gradient descent implementation in gradient_descent_update function in gd.py.

### Notes:

+ Setting the learning_rate to 0.1 should result in x -> 0 and f(x) -> 5 if you've implemented gradient descent correctly.

+ Play around with different values for the learning rate. Try very small values, values close to 1, above 1, etc. What happens?
