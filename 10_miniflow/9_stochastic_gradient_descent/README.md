## Instructions

1. Open `nn.py`. See how the network runs with this new architecture.

2. Find the `sgd_update` method in `miniflow.py` and implement SGD.

3. Test your network! Does your loss decrease with more epochs?

Note! The virtual machines on which we run your code have time limits. If your network takes more than 10 seconds to run, you will get a timeout error. Keep this in mind as you play with the number of epochs.
