## Quiz

Let's see how well you understand `tf.placeholder()` and `feed_dict`. The code below throws an error, but I want you to make it return the number `123`. Change line 11, so that the code returns the number `123`.

Note: The quizzes are running TensorFlow version 0.12.1. However, all the code used in this course is compatible with version 1.0. We'll be upgrading our in class quizzes to the newest version in the near future.
