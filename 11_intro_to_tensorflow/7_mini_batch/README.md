## Question

Implement the batches function to batch features and labels. The function should return each batch with a maximum size of batch_size. To help you with the quiz, look at the following example output of a working batches function.

```python

# 4 Samples of features
example_features = [
    ['F11','F12','F13','F14'],
    ['F21','F22','F23','F24'],
    ['F31','F32','F33','F34'],
    ['F41','F42','F43','F44']]
    
# 4 Samples of labels
example_labels = [
    ['L11','L12'],
    ['L21','L22'],
    ['L31','L32'],
    ['L41','L42']]
    
example_batches = batches(3, example_features, example_labels)

```


The example_batches variable would be the following:

```python

[
    # 2 batches:
    #   First is a batch of size 3.
    #   Second is a batch of size 1
    [
        # First Batch is size 3
        [
            # 3 samples of features.
            # There are 4 features per sample.
            ['F11', 'F12', 'F13', 'F14'],
            ['F21', 'F22', 'F23', 'F24'],
            ['F31', 'F32', 'F33', 'F34']
        ], [
            # 3 samples of labels.
            # There are 2 labels per sample.
            ['L11', 'L12'],
            ['L21', 'L22'],
            ['L31', 'L32']
        ]
    ], [
        # Second Batch is size 1.
        # Since batch size is 3, there is only one sample left from the 4 samples.
        [
            # 1 sample of features.
            ['F41', 'F42', 'F43', 'F44']
        ], [
            # 1 sample of labels.
            ['L41', 'L42']
        ]
    ]
]

```

Implement the batches function in the "quiz.py" file below.
