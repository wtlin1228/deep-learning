## Using Pooling Layers in TensorFlow

In the below exercise, you'll be asked to set up the dimensions of the pooling filters, strides, as well as the appropriate padding. 
You should go over the TensorFlow documentation for `tf.nn.max_pool()`. Padding works the same as it does for a convolution.

### Instructions

1. Finish off each TODO in the maxpool function.
2. Setup the `strides`, `padding` and `ksize` such that the output shape after pooling is `(1, 2, 2, 1)`.
