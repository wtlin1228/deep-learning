### NOT Perceptron

Unlike the other perceptrons we looked at, the NOT operations only cares about one input. 
The operation returns a `0` if the input is `1` and a `1` if it's a `0`. The other inputs to the perceptron are ignored.

In this quiz, you'll set the weights (`weight1`, `weight2`) and bias `bias` to the values that 
calculate the NOT operation on the second input and ignores the first input.
