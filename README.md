## Neural Networks
Neural networks are the bedrock to deep learning. In this section, you’ll learn how they work and test your ability by building a neural network from scratch.

Project: Your first neural network

## Convolutional Neural Networks
Convolutional neural network is the standard for solving vision problems. It’s used in self driving cars, face recognition, medical imaging, and a whole lot more! You’ll learn how this neural network works and apply to a image classification problem.

Project: Image Classification

## Recurrent Neural Networks
Recurrent neural network is great for predicting on sequential data like music and text. With this neural network, you can generate new music, translate a language, or predict a seizure using an electroencephalogram. This section will teach you how to build and train a recurrent neural.

Project: Generate TV Scripts
Project: Translation Project

## Generative Adversarial Networks
Generative adversarial networks are a type of unsupervised learning where two neural networks compete against each other. This is commonly used to generate image data. You’ll learn how to build your own generative adversarial network and pit two neural networks against each other.
